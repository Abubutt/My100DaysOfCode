# My100DaysOfCode

What I learned and the project I did each day for 100 days in a row.

# Day 1

I learned about Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String Manipulation and applied it to a band name generator at the end.

# Day 2

I learned about different data types and type errors. ALso data type conversion and mathematical operations in python. I applied what I learned today to a tip calculator project.

# Day 3

I learned about control flow and conditional/logical operators. I applied this to a treasure island project.

# Day 4

I learned about the random module in python and the list data structure and combine them both to build a Rock Paper Scissor game.

# Day 5

I learned about for loops and while loops alongside the range function. Using this I built a password generator.

# Day 6

I learned about functions and how they are called. I applied this to a robot maze game called Reborg's World.

# Day 7

I learned about flow charts and how to import python files to your project. Also using what I learned from previous days, I built a hangman game.

# Day 8

I learned more about functions and parameters. Using what I learned I built a caesar cipher program.

# Day 9

I learned about dictionaries and how to nest different structures in them. I applied this to a auction project.

# Day 10

I learned more about function, dictionaries, flags, and recursion. I applied this to a calculator project.

# Day 11

Used everything I learned from the past 10 days to build a Blackjack capstone project.

# Day 12

I learned about global/local scopes in python and constant variables. I applied this to a number guessing game.

# Day 13

I learned about debugging tips and tricks. I applied this to previous coding exercises that had bugs in them.
